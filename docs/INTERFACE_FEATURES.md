# Interface Features

Prototype status of the web UI (`index.html`, `editor.html`, `index.js`, `editor.js`). A feature is **implemented** when the interface exposes working behavior (not merely static markup or placeholder controls).

**Summary:** 70 implemented · 0 not implemented · 0 partial

> **Note:** Transitions and effects are stored on clips and exposed in the UI; MLT render integration for transition/effect filters is not yet wired in `TimelineAssembler`. For a full **Kdenlive parity** roadmap (implemented / partial / missing), see [`KDENLIVE_FEATURES.md`](KDENLIVE_FEATURES.md).
